# Cobalt2 Theme Fork for VS Code

This is a fork from [the official cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) in which I've completely changed the 
font colors to support a wider range of languages. I tried to to be the more generic possible and avoiding using attibutes for specific languages to do so.
